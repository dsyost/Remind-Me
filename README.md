<h1> Remind-Me </h1>
<p>
This is a program I wrote for going semi-afk on games like oldschool runescape.  The program works by constantly checking a selected area from change over time.  There is a counter counting down and if change is detected the counter is reset.  If the counter hits zero then a reminder message is audible spoken.  All variables can be changed but the user.  To start the program first click <i>Get First Point</i> and place your cursor in the upper left hand corner of the area you wish to check.  Next do the same with <i>Get Second Point</i> for the lower right hand corner.  You can check to make sure you have selected the right area by pressing the check area button. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> this program only works on a main display.  If you have a multi monitor display change your main display to the screen you wish to check.  Happy afking!!!
